# 1. Wellness Product & Service Affiliates
Partner with therapy platforms, meditation apps, or self-care brands (like Headspace, BetterHelp, or Calm).
Show personalized recommendations in the AI chat or journal section.
Example: If a user journals about stress, the app can suggest a stress-relief product with an affiliate link.
How to Implement:

Use context-aware suggestions (via AI chat or journal insights).
Embed affiliate links subtly in responses (e.g., “You might find this mindfulness app helpful”).
# 2. Book & Course Recommendations
Suggest self-help books, therapy guides, or online mental health courses via Amazon, Udemy, or Coursera affiliate programs.
Example: If a user plays a cognitive therapy game, recommend a book on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).
Where to Display:
✅ AI chat suggestions
✅ "Recommended Reads" section in the journal
✅ A separate resource hub inside the app

# 3. Affiliate Partnerships with Therapy Services
Offer discounts for therapy platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace using referral links.
Users who sign up through your link can get a discount, and you earn a commission.
Best Placement:

After AI chat sessions (e.g., “Would you like to speak with a professional?”)
In the journal insights section
In the game’s progress tracking, as a tip
# 4. Wellness & Self-Care Product Affiliates
Partner with brands offering supplements, aromatherapy, sleep aids, and wellness gadgets (e.g., weighted blankets, essential oils).
Suggest these as part of a mental wellness routine.
Integration Idea:
🛒 A small "Wellness Shop" inside the app with trusted recommendations.
💡 AI chatbot suggests a product when users mention sleep issues, anxiety, or focus problems.

# 5. Gamification with Affiliate Rewards
Users earn points by journaling or playing the mental health game.
Points can be redeemed for discounts on partner products/services.
Example: “Earn 100 points and get 10% off a mindfulness course!”
How It Works:

Track user engagement.
Integrate with partners who offer discount codes.
Display deals in a “Rewards” or “Achievements” section.
Technical Implementation Ideas
🔹 Use dynamic links that change based on user behavior.
🔹 Track referrals using UTM links stored in MongoDB.
🔹 Display personalized suggestions based on journal entries & chat topics.
