Embed affiliate links subtly in responses (e.g., “You might find this mindfulness app helpful”).
# 2. Book & Course Recommendations

Your Pitch to Shamiri (Example)
Introduction:
"Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I’m the creator of Chatty—an AI-powered mental wellness app designed to provide young people with an interactive and personalized mental health companion. I’m excited to share how Chatty aligns with Shamiri’s mission and how I can contribute to your work in empowering high school students."

Part 1: Aligning with Shamiri’s Work
"I know Shamiri runs a four-week program focusing on key concepts like a growth mindset, gratitude, and value affirmation while also conducting research to measure impact. I believe Chatty could complement this by providing students with a continuous, engaging, and personalized mental wellness tool they can access anytime—before, during, and after the program. This would help reinforce the lessons they learn while also giving Shamiri more opportunities for long-term impact."

Part 2: Key Features of Chatty
"Chatty is more than just an AI chatbot—it’s a mental wellness ecosystem with features tailored to high school students, including:

AI Chat Support – A friendly AI that listens, provides encouragement, and suggests wellness exercises.

Mood Tracker – Helps students monitor their emotions and recognize patterns over time.

Digital Journal – A private space where they can reflect on their thoughts, applying gratitude and self-affirmation techniques.

Mini-Games & Challenges – Activities that make mental wellness fun and interactive, reinforcing a growth mindset.

Daily Prompts & Exercises – Personalized reminders based on their mood and progress in the program."

Part 3: The Impact & Research Potential
"Since Shamiri also conducts research on the effectiveness of its programs, Chatty could be a powerful data collection and engagement tool. The app can track student progress, log their moods over time, and gather anonymous insights on their mental wellness journey—helping Shamiri measure long-term impact beyond the four-week program."

Part 4: Collaboration Opportunities
"I’d love to explore ways we can integrate Chatty into Shamiri’s work. Whether it’s partnering to use Chatty as a post-program engagement tool, enhancing research efforts, or even bringing AI-driven interactions into Shamiri’s curriculum, I believe there’s a great opportunity here."

"And even if Chatty isn’t the right fit at this moment, I’d love to contribute my skills to Shamiri’s mission in any way—whether it’s through technology development, program design, or research support."

Closing:
"I’m really excited about the work you’re doing and would love to hear your thoughts on how we might work together."

Additional Features to Implement Before the Meeting
Since Shamiri focuses on high school students and research, consider adding:

Guided Growth Mindset Exercises – A section where students can set goals, track small achievements, and receive positive reinforcement from the AI.

Daily Affirmations & Gratitude Prompts – Chatty could send students personalized affirmations or gratitude exercises.

Reflective Journaling with AI Feedback – The AI can highlight progress in their mindset based on their journal entries.

Peer Support Chat (Optional) – Allow students to share anonymous positive messages with each other (with strict moderation).

Shamiri Research Integration – A way for Shamiri to track students' mental wellness over time through anonymous data collection (with consent).
